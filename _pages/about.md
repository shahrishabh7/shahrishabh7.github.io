I’m a software engineer and entrepreneur with bias for action.

I most recently worked on the New Products Team at Roku to build our RokuOS continuous integration infrastructure for third-party TVs. I’ve also contributed as a back-end and full-stack engineer at HubSpot and Texas Instruments in the past 3 years.

I am also passionate about investing in real estate. I co-own and operate a [short-term rental](/real-estate/real-estate-1/) in Panama City Beach, Florida fully remotely.

I graduated from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in May 2022 studying Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. During my time at UT, I worked as a Research Associate at the [Koo Research Group](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/koo) and was an [ASME](https://www.utasme.org/) officer. I also captained [Texas Raas](/art/art-1/), an intercollegiate, cultural dance team.

In my free time, you can find me hacking projects, playing chess, or listening to the BiggerPockets Real Estate podcast.
