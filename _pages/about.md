I am currently an engineer at [Roku](https://www.roku.com/) working on scaling our automation framework to eventually handle all RokuOS testing hands-free.

I am also passionate about investing in real estate. I co-own and operate a short-term rental in Panama City Beach, Florida fully remotely.

I graduated from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) in May 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a certificate in Computer Science. During my time at UT, I worked as a Research Associate at the [Koo Research Group](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/koo) and was an officer for [ASME](https://www.utasme.org/). I also captained [Texas Raas](https://utexas.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/texasraas), an intercollegiate dance team. We won the 2022 Raas All-Stars National Championship and represented the University at national events such as [Howdy Modi](https://www.howdymodi.org).

In my free time, you can find me playing chess, watching the Dallas Cowboys, or listening to the BiggerPockets podcast.
