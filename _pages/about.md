I’m currently building AI Agents to extract structured data from the web at [Reworkd (YC S23)](https://reworkd.ai/) in San Francisco, CA.

I previously built developer tools and full-stack applications at [Roku](https://www.roku.com/) and [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/). I graduated from UT Austin in May 2022, studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science.

Some of my hobbies include hacking projects, working out, reading, playing 2k, investing in real estate, watching the Dallas Cowboys, and playing chess.
