Sponsio is an online waging platform where people can propose / accept creative bets. Will Biden wear a striped tie to his speech tonight? Will it snow in New York City on New Year's Eve? Will the first goal in the World Cup final be scored with a header?

The platform is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

I worked on this project with [Kush Desai](https://kushkdesai.com/), [Rohith Mandavilli](https://github.com/rohithm1), and [Prathyush Shankar](https://github.com/prathyush-shankar).
