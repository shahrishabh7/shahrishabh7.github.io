I assisted in the development of an AI research agent capable of posing, running, and evaluating ML experiments autonomously. I was responsible for adding a search action to the agent, giving it the ability to gather information from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03302) papers to hypothesize new research ideas. We benchmarked the model using [MLAgentBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03302), a research agent evaluations framework.
