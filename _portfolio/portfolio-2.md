Sponsio is an online waging platform for individuals looking to initiate and accept creative bets. Groups can also create private circles for their own bets. Will Biden wear a striped tie to his speech tonight? Will Luka drop 62 on the Lakers? Is Team Blue going to win the UMICH intramural basketball tournament?

The platform is built in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and centered around a clean, social media-like feed. We integrated the [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) APIs to allow users to fund their accounts.

I worked on this project with [Kush Desai](https://kushkdesai.com/), [Rohith Mandavilli](https://github.com/rohithm1), and [Prathyush Shankar](https://github.com/prathyush-shankar).
