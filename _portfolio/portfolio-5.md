CityHopper is for the backpacker looking to visit dozens of cities. We used [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to aggregate flight data and presented routes based on whether the priority is lower travel costs, shorter travel time, or an approach in-between.

I worked on this project with [Viraj Parikh](https://github.com/virajxp1). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/City-Hopper).
