CityHopper helps backpackers find optimal multi-city routes. We used [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to aggregate flight data and calculated routes based on distance, time, and monetary costs.

I worked on this project with [Viraj Parikh](https://github.com/virajxp1). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/City-Hopper).
