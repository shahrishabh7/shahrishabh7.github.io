CityHopper is built to help backpackers hopping around many cities to plan optimal travel. We used [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to scrape and aggregate flight data and designed a weighted graphing algorithm to find optimal paths. Multiple, curated routes are presented based on whether the user wants to prioritize cheaper flights, shorter travel time, or an approach in-between.

I worked on this project with [Viraj Parikh](https://github.com/virajxp1). You can find this project [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/City-Hopper).
