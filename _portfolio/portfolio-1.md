This platform brings the power of AI to Airbnb hosts. Hosts can generate unique, optimized content instantly, create contracts for cleaners and handymen, and streamline their launch operations.

The application is powered by OpenAI's ['text-davinci-003' model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

Here's a demo of the content generation feature:

We used [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to aggregate model output data, identify prompting weaknesses, and finetune the algorithm.

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-frontend).
