This application is powered by OpenAI's ['text-davinci-003' model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview). The application writes a unique, SEO-optimized description based on the property location and amenities.

We used [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to aggregate model output data, identify prompting weaknesses, and finetune the algorithm.

A demo result is shown below for a prospective AirBNB in Austin,TX.

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-frontend).
