MosebyAI is an AI Agent built to help Airbnb hosts run and scale their business. The agent helps delegate tasks, communicate with ground team, recommend listing / pricing adjustments, and answer short-term rental management questions (trained on 300+ podcasts)

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-frontend).
