AirBNB HostAI allows hosts to generate unique, optimized listing content instantly, ready to be pasted into hosts' Airbnb listing. We help hosts create their top-level description, paragraphs describing each room, and guest rules. We also have a tool to help hosts generate contracts for cleaners, handymen, and other tradesmen.

The application is powered by OpenAI's ['text-davinci-003' model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).

We used [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to aggregate model output data, identify prompting weaknesses, and finetune the algorithm.

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-frontend).
