This application rates and recommends improvements for AirBNB listings. The code includes an image quality assessment moduel that checks for white spots, darkness, and blurriness. Written content is examined and graded for grammar, readability, language, and specificity (house amenities, nearby attractions).

We used [openCV](https://opencv.org/) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/).

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-backend).
