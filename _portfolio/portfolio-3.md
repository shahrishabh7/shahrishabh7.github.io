This backend module evaluates AirBNB listing images and descriptions based on best practices. Images are evaluated using Computer Vision for white spots, darkness, and blurriness. Description is examined and graded for grammar, readability, language, and specificity (house amenities, nearby attractions).

We leveraged [openCV](https://opencv.org/) to evaluate the images and [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) for natural language processing methods.

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-backend).
