This backend module evaluates AirBNB listing images and descriptions based on best practices. An Image Quality Assessment module evaluates listing images for white spots, darkness, and blurriness. Written content is examined and graded for grammar, readability, language, and specificity (house amenities, nearby attractions).

We leveraged [openCV](https://opencv.org/) to evaluate the images and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for natural language processing methods.

I worked on this project with [Nithanth Ram](https://github.com/Nithanth). You can find it [here](https://github.com/shahrishabh7/listing-rater-backend).
