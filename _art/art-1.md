Texas Raas is an intercollegiate, cultural dance team of 24 individuals that competes nationally. I joined the team in 2018 and captained from 2020 - 2022. We most notably performed at the [Howdy Modi](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-s-howdy-modi-event-in-numbers/story-aWKhz0zKcpPlUcu6uVJgkJ.html) convention in 2020, an event broadcasted internationally to over 30 million people.

We also won the 2022 Raas-All Stars XIV National Championship. Here is our performance.

Our soundtrack can be found below, I built it alongside [Rohan Varshney](https://rohanvarshney.github.io/) and [Viraj Parikh](https://github.com/virajxp1). We handpicked traditional Indian folk songs and made a cute, animated mix with elements from The Jungle Book soundtrack, Donkey Kong soundtrack, and Asiatic forest sounds and instruments.

We DIY engineered our props using (mainly) PVC, wood, foam board, and canvas. Here's an image of the set.
