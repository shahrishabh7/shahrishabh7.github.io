Texas Raas is UT Austin's nationally competitive Raas-Garba team. We specialize in a folk dance that originates from Gujarat, India.

During my time on the team, We performed at the [Howdy Modi](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-s-howdy-modi-event-in-numbers/story-aWKhz0zKcpPlUcu6uVJgkJ.html) convention in 2020, an event broadcasted internationally to over 30 million people.

During my captain year, we won the 2022 Raas-All Stars XIV National Championship.

We handpicked traditional Indian folk songs and made an animated mix with elements from The Jungle Book soundtrack, Donkey Kong soundtrack, and Asiatic forest sounds and instruments. I worked with [Rohan Varshney](https://rohanvarshney.github.io/) to engineer this track, check it out below.

We DIY engineered our props using (mainly) PVC, wood, foam board, and canvas. Here's an image of the set.
